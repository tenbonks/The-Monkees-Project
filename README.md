# The-Monkees-Project



This is a website, for The Monkees, they've been rockin' since the 60's and have been growing ever since. 
This site facilitates their growth with a catalougue of their greatest hits with space to expand for any new content, images from their past, qoutes from the members, 
gig dates and a contact form so a user can enquire about booking them for a private function.

Here's a link to the deployed site - https://tenbonks.github.io/The-Monkees-Project/#

## UX



I created a wireframe using "Pencil" and a mockup using "Adobe XD", the website is created with the target audience being current/potential fans for "The Monkees".
It allows a user to see the bands music (via mp3 and mp4), famous qoutes from the members, any news relative to the band and also a live section where it showcases gig dates and a contact form.
All of this is acheived in a single scrolling page with vividly coloured sections, along with the links in the header, it is very easy to view the content and find what the user is looking for.

##### User Stories

1. As a FAN, I want to view news stories, so I can stay up to date with my favourite band
2. As a FAN, I want to see if they are available, so I can book them for my wedding
3. as a FAN, I want to listen to The Monkees, so I can relive some memories 
4. as a FAN, I want to see if they still have tickets for their St Kilda show, so I can attend
5. as a FAN, I want to see if they have any social spaces, So I can join them

##### Features Left to Implement

A sign up to news letter, originally I thought about implementing this but didn't see it as necessary.
I wanted to use JS to make the song cards be the album artwork with a play button in the middle, this style is widely used in other apps, such as Spotify and I-tunes, to make it look cleaner and a bit more modern.
Expandable sections so there will be an arrow at the bottom of each section which will drop down the section to reveal more content.

## Technologies Used

This project was made using HTML, CSS, and some JS was used but this was acheived using Bootstrap 4/JQuery
