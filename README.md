# The-Monkees-Project



This is a website, for The Monkees, they've been rockin' since the 60's and have been growing ever since. 
This site facilitates their growth with a catalougue of their greatest hits with space to expand for any new content, images from their past, qoutes from the members, 
gig dates and a contact form so a user can enquire about booking them for a private function.

## UX



I created a wireframe using "Pencil" and a mockup using "Adobe XD", the website is created with the target audience being current/potential fans for "The Monkees".
It allows a user to see the bands music (via mp3 and mp4), famous qoutes from the members, any news relative to the band and also a live section where it showcases gig dates and a contact form.
All of this is acheived in a single scrolling page with vividly coloured sections, along with the links in the header, it is very easy to view the content and find what the user is looking for.

##### User Stories
